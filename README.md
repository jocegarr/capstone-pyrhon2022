# Capstone Project
# Python Class 2022

As my final project I wanted to put together a summary for a program that is supported by a financial company. I wanted to give a quick overview of the health and activity of the program.

I compared volume and application activity of current year to previous years to notice if there were any trends.

This is a high-level summary but it would be very helpful in my space of work. I currently do these in powerpoint or Qlikview but enjoyed the opportunity to use Python to put a sample together.
